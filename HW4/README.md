## Assignment 1 : Distributions 

I tested the correlation of the age distribution of Male vs Female riders and Day vs Night riders using June 2015 citibikes dataset.

Male vs Female riders

Pearson's test: It implies no linear relationship correlation because it is between -1 and +1 with 0, therefore we accept the null hypothesis.

Spearman's test: Since it is between -1 and +1 with 0, implies that there's no monotonic correlation relationship.

K-S test: Using a = .05, we reject the null hypothesis that these samples are drawn from the same distribution

Day vs Night riders
