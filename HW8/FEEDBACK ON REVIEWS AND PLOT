the reviews are good and helpful 10/10

NOTES ON YOUR PLOT
===================

nice simple plot

too much empty space on the top: distracting (and even on the left)

small tick labels






NOTES ON YOUR PLOT THE PLOTS YOU REVIEWED
===========================================


dk2926
============

missing x label

y label too small

size of points is unexplained

the large number of points causes crowdedness and ibstruction. consider contour plots instead where the density of points is too high



rbc299
============
the 2 points default in the legend should he substituted by a single plot as it is redundant and with large points it overlaps

missing units on x and y axis


the y tick labels should be in a more compressed readable notation, e.g. change units to millions


the empty space in the plot is distracting and does not help comparison (remember tufte's rules) 

the point size is unexplained

the color of Bk and Bx is indistinguishable at first sight

the legend shows "dot size reflects..." which belongs in a separate label, not in the legend, and it confuses the association of the blue color to SI.

size differential too large





tg1442
============
  
too many vivid colors are distracting

agegroup one word in the tiel

thousands is not ameaningful axis labels; use "Population (units of 1,000 peope")

and then why use units of 1000 when your first tick label is 1e5? then one has to think what 1e5*1000 is. use units of millions, and then your first tick is 100 etc
