#PUI 2015 HW #3 Assignment 1 - Distributions

Generate 100 samples of different sizes N (N>10 & N<2000).
For 6 different distributions, I chose Normal, Poisson, Binomial, Chi-Squared, Rayleigh and Logistic.

Population: mean = 100
Binomial: p = 0.5
Log: scale = 1
Gaus: sd = 10

Results: The larger the sample size, the closer the sample value to the population mean

#PUI 2015 HW#3 Assignment 2 - Hypothesis testing

We compared two variables using the Z-score Normal Distribution data and percentage points of the Chi-Square Distribution. 

alpha = 0.05

Results: Since the result for employment for >6 consecutive months is 1.589, less than the critical value of 3.84, which has a higher p=0.25. Therefore we accept the null hypothesis, meaning that the percentage for former prisoners employed for 6+ years after release is the same or lower for candidates who participated in the program as part of the control group.
